# Responsive portfolio page
This portfolio page is based on [Ania Kubow's responsive portfolio repo](https://github.com/kubowania/responsive-portfolio) with my own tweaks, including:
- Project card stacking in mobile mode
- Expandable project cards
- Pill-button tags
- Scroll-to-top button

---

The page is currently made with just html, css and javascript; but as the portfolio grows, migrating to a framework is definitely in the cards later down the road.
